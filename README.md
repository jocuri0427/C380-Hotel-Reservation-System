- don't follow the video on how to clone your repo. its hard and i've tried (pause)

anyways, how to use git:
- clone repo using desktop app (it's easiest, trust me)
- start coding and editing
- once you've called it a day, use this command in terminal:
    "git add ." to add all changes to commit or
    "git add [file name]" to save change to a specific file/folder
- then you use this command
    "git commit -m "[message here]" to save to your branch and insert a message about the commit
- finally once all code is finalized with the group and good to go, use this command
    "git push" to push to public repo

NOTE: please please please do not add multiple little commits to your code. one big batch then commit. thanks
NOTE: if there's a file that hasn't been created yet, push a empty file on the repo where you will work code on so that anyone that needs access to it can collaborate and create branches of code.
